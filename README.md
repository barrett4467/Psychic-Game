# Psychic-Game
Psychic Game is an application built using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a game in which a random letter is selected. The player can make up to 10 guesses to reveal the current letter. If the letter is guessed before the player hits 10 guesses, the user will win the round and the letter will appear in the crystal ball. At this point the player can choose to guess another letter.
